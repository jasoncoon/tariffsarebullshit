>Dear Valued Retailer,
>
>We want to inform you of an upcoming pricing change affecting a portion of our product catalog, effective April 26, 2025. This adjustment is in response to recent federal tariff announcements, including a 145% tariff on Chinese-manufactured goods and a 10% blanket tariff on imports from other countries.
>
>Orders placed before April 26 will still receive current pricing and honor all existing quotes.
>
>We understand that price changes can be challenging, especially for independent retailers like you who rely on consistency and value. Please know that this decision was not made lightly. Our team is working diligently to minimize the impact by:
>- Actively negotiating with our vendors
>- Optimizing freight and shipping contracts
>- Shifting sourcing to tariff-minimized and domestic suppliers wherever possible
>
>We continue to offer flat-rate shipping starting at just $7.95*, so you can stock up without worrying about unpredictable freight charges. It’s one more way we’re helping you keep operating costs low.
>
>These efforts reflect our continued commitment to helping you run your business efficiently and cost-effectively.
>
>Our mission has always been to provide you with quality products at the lowest possible prices—and that hasn’t changed. We will continue to offer industry-leading value, and we stand behind our price match guarantee to ensure you always get the best deal.
>
>If you have any questions or would like support planning purchases before the new pricing takes effect, our sales and customer service teams are here and ready to help.
>
>Thank you for your continued trust in Store Supply Warehouse. We are proud to serve you and remain committed to your success.
>
>Sincerely,
>
>The Store Supply Warehouse Team
